# Spinner's Pizza Website

Welcome to the official website for **Spinner's Pizza**, a local pizzeria, BBQ, and burger joint in **Grovespring, MO**. This website was created as a project to support **Spinner's Pizza**, a beloved family-owned business in the community. It was a way for me to contribute something special to my dad's friend Tim, who runs the pizza place, and give them an online presence that reflects their hard work and delicious offerings.

## Purpose of the Website

The goal of this website is to provide a digital space for **Spinner's Pizza** to showcase their menu, restaurant hours, customer reviews, and location. The website also includes a gallery of the restaurant‚Äôs interior, giving potential customers a glimpse into the cozy and welcoming atmosphere.

This project was created out of love for the local community, as well as a desire to support my dad's hobby pig farm, which operates nearby. My dad wanted to give Tim some street cred, and this website was a perfect way to do that. I worked on this for free to help promote the pizzeria and to give back to the community.

## Features

- **Menu Section**: A detailed menu that showcases the variety of food options available at Spinner's Pizza, including house specials, appetizers, pizzas, burgers, and desserts.

- **Discounts for Heroes**: A section dedicated to honoring first responders, service members, and police officers with special discounts.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is built with responsive design, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Why I Created This Website

I created this website as part of my journey to give back to the local community while practicing my skills in web development. My dad wanted to help his friend Tim at Spinner's Pizza by giving him a professional website, and I was happy to step in and make it happen. The website is fully functional and designed to help attract new customers and support the local business.
